# What's in an Avocado Toast: A Supply Chain Analysis

This repository contains my completed solution to the **Python DataCamp Challenge**:  
*What's in an Avocado Toast: A Supply Chain Analysis*.

## Project Description
The task explores the supply chain of key ingredients in a simple avocado toast recipe.  
The dish requires:
- Avocado  
- Lemon  
- Salt flakes  
- Sourdough bread  
- Extra virgin olive oil  

Using the **Open Food Facts** database, the challenge focuses on analyzing the origins and supply chain of three selected ingredients. The goal is to highlight the global complexity behind seemingly simple food items.

## Objectives
- Query and analyze food product data from the Open Food Facts database.  
- Trace ingredient origins and supply chain paths.  
- Gain insight into international sourcing and dependencies in food production.  

## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  

## Key Takeaways
- Everyday food items often rely on global supply chains.  
- Ingredients like avocado, lemon, and olive oil have diverse sourcing patterns.  
- Open data sources such as **Open Food Facts** are useful for real-world supply chain analysis.
